We start by discussing some possible justifications for economic inequality, drawing on research in economics as well as philosophy. We then turn to discuss the evidence of what people prefer and believe about inequality, including their possible justifications for economic inequality. We discuss the views and beliefs of general populations across the globe. We further aim to relate these views and beliefs to political support for redistribution and welfare policies more generally. Gender inequalities in earnings may have historical roots and may persist because of contemporary norms supporting that men should be the breadwinners in the family. We discuss the prevalence of such norms. We also discuss possible gender differences in willingness to compete, willingness to take risks, and preferences for job-life versus family life. We then turn to a discussion of discrimination in the labor market using global data as empirical evidence. Household formation may affect gender inequalities and gender inequalities may affect household formation. We discuss models of the marriage market and some empirical evidence. We further discuss the efficiency of welfare policies targeting families, and how the focus on whether gender targeting is beneficial or not.",

This includes topics on family economics and gender inequality, household formation and decision-making, the measurement of inequality across individuals and groups of individuals, and discussions about poverty and poverty traps. We discuss the measurement of inequality and some empirical facts about inequality within and across countries, family economics and gender, household formation and division of tasks within households and in society, child development, intergenerational mobility, and poverty, both in Western societies and in developing countries, poverty trap means, and what kinds of poverty traps that may exist in low- and middle-income countries as well as high-income countries such as the United States. The course benefits from the behavioral and experimental economics literature as well as the labor literature on labor markets and family economics. The focus is on theoretical frameworks that help understand human behavior as well as on empirical evidence on particular drivers and consequences of observed behavior.",

    "description": "Where is the research frontier on trade and development? Which empirical methods are most used at the frontier? How can they be leveraged to strengthen modeling-intensive papers? What is the role of theory and of structural estimation in this subfield? This course begins with a systematic survey of the most influential papers in trade and development in the past twenty years, characterizing them on empirical approach, role of theory, and type of contribution. In the first half of the course, students (a) revisit commonly used empirical methods (e.g., shift-share, difference-in-differences, matching, etc.), understand their strengths and limitations for questions in trade and development and practice implementing them in replication exercises; (b) critique papers in short referee reports and in-class discussions; and (c) apply learned empirical methods and theoretical insights to a novel research proposal. In the second half of the course, students focus on advancing their research proposal. We focus on content and on exposition. Progress entails (a) critiquing each other\u2019s work, offering actionable feedback and reporting progress; (b) rewrites of their proposal (in slides and in prose), with special attention paid to placement in literature and clear communication; and (c) delivering a final presentation of their research. This is a coding-intensive, writing-intensive, critique-driven course. It is best suited for advanced Ph.D. students in either trade or development already working on independent research (e.g.,years 2-4), but all Ph.D. students are welcome. The course is especially valuable to students working on structure-intensive topics (e.g., networks, spatial, urban) who might not otherwise have practical exposure to reduced-form empirics and can learn to leverage those to strengthen their research.",

Behavioral finance is a large and active field that studies models in which some agents are less than fully rational. Such models have two building blocks: limits to arbitrage, which make it difficult for rational traders to undo the dislocations caused by less rational traders; and psychology, which catalogues the kinds of deviations from full rationality we might expect to see. We discuss these two topics and then consider a number of applications: asset pricing (the aggregate stock market and the cross-section of average returns); individual trading behavior; and corporate finance (security issuance, corporate investment, and mergers).",

We also provide economic foundations for the emergence of social norms and identity, as well as the dynamic inefficiencies that they can generate with economic development.
