    "description": "This course provides an introduction to mental health and illness with a focus on the complex interplay between risk and protective factors and social and cultural influences on mental health status. We examine the role of social and cultural factors in the etiology, course, and treatment of substance misuse; depressive, anxiety, and psychotic disorders; and some of the severe behavioral disorders of childhood. The social consequences of mental illness such as stigma, isolation, and barriers to care are explored, and their impact on access to care and recovery considered. The effectiveness of the current system of services and the role of public health and public health professionals in mental health promotion are discussed.",

The course adopts an epistemological approach that centers \"encounter\" across geopolitical scales and multiple disciplinary fronts in the humanities and social sciences. It posits that research methods, regardless of their origin, can adopt feminist, queer, decolonial/postcolonial, and critical race perspectives and potentially serve counter-disciplinary purposes. Although we cover a broad spectrum of methods\u2014ranging from ethnographic, historiographic/archival, and geographic, to literary, media, and textual analysis, cultural studies, and political theory\u2014our work does not unfold as a practicum. Instead of experimenting with a predefined \"toolkit,\" students critically engage book-length works that demonstrate counter-disciplinary methodologies, reflecting hermeneutically on how method and theory relate in these texts by drawing on Foucault's framework of \"the archaeology of knowledge.\"",

The course seeks to provide students with an introduction to the range of sustainability issues and challenges that companies face in today\u2019s fast-changing marketplace. It introduces key corporate sustainability terms, concepts, tools, strategies, and frameworks based on the overarching theory that the traditional profit-maximizing mission of business (often called shareholder primacy) is giving way to a new vision of stakeholder responsibility that still seeks to provide good returns to the enterprise\u2019s owners but also acknowledges obligations to employees, suppliers, customers, communities, and society more broadly. The course combines lectures, case studies, and class discussions on management theory and tools, the legal and regulatory frameworks that shape the business-environment interface, and the evolving role of business in society. It explores how to deal with a world of diverse stakeholders, increasing transparency, and rising expectations related to corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance.

    "title": "What was Latinx Literature",
    "description": "With the arrival of \"Latinx,\" the last decade was defined as a moment of rupture and break with traditional notions of latinidad. Artists and activists asserted refusal and historical reckoning as the mode of doing politics and aesthetics. Now, pessimistic about Latinx as a signifier of a unified political project, the generational tides have shifted to \"Latine.\" This seminar asks what is \"Latinx literature\" and why are the methods of \"Latinx studies\" considered revolutionary or disruptive? What ideas were rooted in prior generations of feminist and queer collectives that sustained life when the arrival of a decolonial future seemed forever deferred and withheld from reach? We examine contemporary artists alongside historical antecedents to reevaluate what literary and social forms can help us challenge a racialized, heteronormative conception of citizenship. One possibility is that Gloria Anzald\u00faa\u2014rightly critiqued for her relation to mestizaje \u2014might be helpful in this moment of growing nationalism and hostility towards migrants to think about other ways of organizing life aside borders and the nation. We read across a long and varied arc of creative expression to consider forms that endure amidst colonial duress. For example: the serial, montage, anthology, performance collective, and inter-linked storytelling. Artists up for discussion may include Natalie Diaz, John Rechy, and Jes\u00fas Col\u00f3n. Students will engage these works alongside theorists like Jos\u00e9 Esteban Mu\u00f1oz and Juana Mar\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez. Previously ENGL 331.",

It situates the end of slavery in the United States within hemispheric and transatlantic contexts, touching upon processes of abolition\u00a0in Antigua, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, and more. The course approaches abolition as a historiographical problem, considering debates about its definition, its causes and consequences, its primary agents, its periodization, and its relation to other historical processes. Questions include: How have historians defined abolition? How have they periodized it? How have scholars variously characterized the forms it took and who was responsible for it? How have they differently understood the social, cultural, economic, legal, and political conditions that gave rise to abolition? How have historians agreed and disagreed upon its effects and its aftermath? How have they framed the relation between freedom and formal emancipation? How have the communicated the stakes of their accounts of abolition? The organization of the course is topical and loosely chronological. Readings address the origins of abolition in the Atlantic world, the Haitian Revolution, processes of gradual emancipation, the historical significance of Black abolitionists, the activism of women and children, the formation and contributions of antislavery movements, the practice of moral suasion, the question of violence and antislavery militantism, antislavery discourses of rights and sexual morals, the circulation of racial and climate science in abolitionist circles, enslaved people\u2019s practices of fugitivity, self-purchase, and revolt, the relation between capitalism and abolitionism, the Civil War, and the so-called \"last abolition\" of slavery in Brazil.",
