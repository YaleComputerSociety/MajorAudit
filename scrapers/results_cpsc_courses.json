This course covers the foundations of lattice-based cryptography from fundamental definitions to advanced cryptographic constructions. More precisely, we introduce the Learning with Error (LWE) and the Short Integer Solutions (SIS) problems and study their unique properties, such as the fact that their average-case hardness is based on the worst-case hardness of lattice problems. Next, we cover lattice constructions of advanced cryptographic primitives, such as fully homomorphic encryption and signature schemes. Finally, we introduce some notions of quantum cryptography and explore the role of lattices in this area.\u202fOverall, this course offers insights into the foundations and recent advancements in lattice-based cryptography.",

    "description": "Today\u2019s society comprises humans living in an interconnected world that is intertwined with a variety of sensing, communicating, and computing devices. Human-generated data is being recorded at unprecedented rates and scales, and powerful AI and ML algorithms, which are capable of learning from such data, are increasingly controlling various aspects of modern society: from social interactions. These data-driven decision-making algorithms have a tremendous potential to change our lives for the better, but, via the ability to mimic and nudge human behavior, they also have the potential to be discriminatory, reinforce societal prejudices, violate privacy, polarize opinions, and influence democratic processes. Thus, designing effective tools to govern modern society which reinforce its cherished values such as equity, justice, democracy, health, privacy, etc. has become paramount and requires a foundational understanding of how humans, data, and algorithms interact. This course is for students who would like to understand and address some of the key challenges and emerging topics at the aforementioned interplay between computation and society. On the one hand, we study human decision-making processes and view them through the lens of computation and on the other hand we study and address the limitations of artificial decision-making algorithms when deployed in various societal contexts. The focus is on developing solutions through a combination of foundational work such as coming up with the right definitions, modeling, algorithms, and empirical evaluation. The current focus is on bias and privacy, with additional topics including robustness, polarization, and democratic representation.",

We discuss the role of regularization and extend linear regression to ridge regression. We also cover optimization, beginning from gradient descent and extending it to stochastic gradient descent and its momentum variant; the concept of alternating optimization; the curse of dimensionality; and topics on dimensionality reduction.

Additional topics may include: geometry processing, scene organization, texturing techniques, advanced lighting techniques, compute shaders, and topics in performance.",

Building on these foundations, we explore transformer architectures and their evolution, including early transformer language models like BERT, GPT and T5. The course examines how these models enable sophisticated language understanding and generation through pre-training and transfer learning. The latter portion covers contemporary advances: Large Language Models (LLMs), multi-modal integration, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, evaluation, multi-agent systems, reasoning, and model compression.

Inquiries into the transpacific history of computer science (CS) can teach us that these relationships have been much more dynamic than \u2018Friend or Foe,\u2019 and have shaped CS in various ways. When cutting-edge computing capabilities are at the forefront of national interests, studying CS and U.S.-Asia relations should no longer be separate intellectual tasks, and multi-view perspectives are needed to understand both processes. This course combines lectures with team-based activities to explore the decentered, international history of CS. We focus on the transpacific relations between the United States and East Asian countries, including Asian diasporas in North America. The course focuses on CS research and engineering, with less emphasis on (anti-)social implications such as mis/dis-information and data privacy. The subjects of study include: China-born first-generation digital computer pioneers; digitizing Asian characters; developing transpacific networks of computers and labor; transpacific works in building CS fundamentals. The course culminates with current moods of exclusionism, trade protectionism, and \u2018friendshoring\u2019 across Asia-Pacific regions.",

The aim of this course is to explain what these problems are and to discuss their solutions. Related concepts from spectral graph theory, rigid graph theory, non-homogeneous Markov chain theory, stability theory, and linear system theory are covered. Although most of the mathematics need is covered in the lectures, students taking this course should have a working understanding of basic linear algebra. The course is open to all students.",

We also cover domain-specific hardware (e.g., graphics processing units), and ongoing industry efforts to elevate them to the status of first-class computing units. In tandem, we cover topics relevant to both general-purpose and domain-specific computing, including memory hierarchies, address translation and virtual memory, on-chip networks, machine learning techniques for resource management, and coherence techniques. If time permits, we will study the basics of emerging non-classical computing paradigms like neuromorphic computing. Overall, this course offers insights on how the computing industry is combating the waning of traditional technology scaling via acceleration and heterogeneity.",
