    "title": "The Archaeology of Trade and Exchange",
    "description": "This seminar will focus on archaeological approaches to exchange and trade. As background, we will review some of the principal theories of exchange from anthropology and sociology, such as those of Mauss, Malinowski and Polanyi. The role of trade and exchange in different kinds of societies will examined by contextualizing these transactions within specific cultural configurations and considering the nature of production and consumption as they relate to movement of these goods. We will consider methods and models that have been used to analyze regions of interaction at different spatial scales and the theoretical arguments about the social impact of inter-regional and intra-regional interactions involving the transfer of goods, including approaches such as world systems, unequal development and globalization. In addition, we will examine the ways that have been utilized in archaeology to identify different kinds of exchange systems, often through analogies to well documented ethnographic and historic cases. Finally, we will consider the range of techniques that have been employed in order to track the movement of goods across space. These sourcing techniques will be evaluated in terms of their advantages and disadvantages from an archaeological perspective, and how the best technical analyses may vary according to the nature of natural or cultural materials under consideration (ceramics, volcanic stone, metals, etc.). The theme for this year\u2019s seminar is obsidian so students should select some aspect of obsidian research for their final paper and presentation.",

    "description": "In recent times, world cinema has witnessed the rise of South Korean cinema as an alternative to Hollywood and includes many distinguished directors such as Park Chan-wook, Lee Chang-dong, Kim Ki-duk, and Bong Joon-ho. This course explores the Korean film history and aesthetics from its colonial days (1910-1945) to the hallyu era (2001-present), and also analyzes several key texts that are critical for understanding this field of study. How is Korean cinema shaped by (re)interpretations of history and society? How do we understand Korean cinema vis-\u00e0-vis the public memories of the Korean War, industrialization, social movements, economic development, and globalization? And how do aesthetics and storytelling in Korean cinema contribute to its popularity among local spectators and to its globality in shaping the contours of world cinema? By deeply inquiring into such questions, students learn how to critically view, think about, and write about film. Primary texts include literature and film. All films are screened with English subtitles.",

In this transhistorical and interdisciplinary course, we chart the history of Shakespeare\u2019s celebrity, from the first publication of his works to their first adaptations in the Restoration, from Garrick\u2019s Shakespeare Jubilee to the preservation of the Shakespeare Birthplace that he put on the map, from the recreation of the Globe Theatre to the role of Shakespeare in our contemporary cultural imagination. We read\u00a0Romeo and Juliet,\u00a0Hamlet, and\u00a0Macbeth\u00a0alongside a wide range of adaptations and cultural objects they inspire, using television, film, graphic novels, short stories, advertising, toys and souvenirs, and even tumblr poetry to consider how Shakespeare\u2019s legacy evolves to meet the needs of changing eras. By the end of the course, we curate a collection of contemporary Shakespeariana to consider what Shakespeare means to our popular imagination.",

    "title": "What Was Reading?",
    "description": "This course takes a long and curious view of the history of reading, using primary sources, material objects, historical records, and contemporary debates to unsettle our assumptions about what reading is and does. How have ideas about the meaning and purpose of reading changed over time? What methods or goals have fallen out of favor, and which continue to shape our ideologies of reading today? What relation is there between the reading we do in a Yale English class, and the reading we do on the beach, or at synagogue, or online\u2015and where do those different sorts of reading come from? The syllabus focuses on early modern English literature, but it also engages ongoing debates about reading in the present, seeking both to link them to and distinguish them from earlier controversies. For instance, a unit on reading as religion raises questions about the morally improving (or morally destabilizing) effects of scriptural interpretation that then haunt later debates about the merits and limitations of anti-racist reading, as James Baldwin argues; similarly, early arguments about the effeminating influence of certain books--especially those aimed at women or young readers--give rise to assumptions about gender and genre that still shape our ambivalence toward reading for pleasure. As we explore these older efforts to shape, inform, regulate, or liberate reading, we\u2019ll also experiment with our own readerly practices, using forgotten or neglected forms like the commonplace book, the moral commentary, or the meditation as foils to the more usual modes of academic writing.",

    "title": "Sound/Image Practice",
    "description": "We start from the assumption that sound is actually the \u2018secret-sauce\u2019 in the film/videomaking process. Often overlooked\u2013or at least neglected, sound is a potent tool to advance the logic of a film or video and even more, to enhance the emotional patina and immersive engagement of a film or video. Sound becomes an accessible portal to the perhaps overlooked not-quite-conscious realm of the film/video experience. While we certainly read some theory/history of sound, this is primarily a class of making. The first 7 weeks include videomaking exercises designed to highlight specific challenges in sound for picture. The core concern is with conceptual development in the myriad ways that sound and picture work together. There is no genre or mode preference in this class. Fiction, non-fiction, experimental, animation, game, tiktok, anything is okay. For the second half of the semester, each student (or collaborative small group\u2013with permission) design, shoot, edit, and mix a short (3-5min) video of their own design\u2013a video that demonstrates attention and developing sophistication in the use of sound with picture, as well as in how to design visual shots and temporal structures (editing) with sound in mind. The visual and auditory aspects of any video are entangled in such a way that contribute (when blended with the audience\u2019s imagination and memory) to the formation of the Sound/Image in the audience member\u2019s minds.",

How were intellectual and everyday life in the Soviet Union and China distinct from and similar to that of the West of the same era? How do we parse \"the cultural logic of late socialism?\" What can today\u2019s America learn from it? Examining two major socialist cultures together in a global context, this course queries the ethnographic, ideological, and socio-economic constituents of late socialism. Students analyze cultural materials in the context of Soviet and Chinese history. Along the way, we explore themes of identity, nationalism, globalization, capitalism, and the Cold War.\u00a0Students with knowledge of Russian and Chinese are encouraged to read in original languages.

    "description": "This course is designed to expose students to the breadth of public health and is required of M.S. and Ph.D. students who do not have prior degrees in public health. It explores the major public health achievements in the last century in order to provide students with a conceptual interdisciplinary framework by which effective interventions are developed and implemented. Case studies and discussions examine the advances across public health disciplines including epidemiology and biostatistics, environmental and behavioral sciences, and health policy and management services that led to these major public health achievements. The course examines global and national trends in the burden of disease and underlying determinants of disease, which pose new challenges; and it covers new approaches that are on the forefront of addressing current and future public health needs.",

    "description": "An integrative overview of the structure and function of the human brain as it pertains to major neurological and psychiatric disorders. Neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and clinical correlations are interrelated to provide essential background in the neurosciences. Lectures in neurocytology and neuroanatomy survey neuronal organization in the human brain, with emphasis on long fiber tracts related to clinical neurology. Lectures in neurophysiology cover various aspects of neural function at the cellular and systems levels, with a strong emphasis on the mammalian nervous system. Clinical correlations consist of sessions applying basic science principles to understanding pathophysiology in the context of patients. Seven three-hour laboratory sessions are coordinated with lectures throughout the course to provide an understanding of the structural basis of function and disease. Case-based conference sections provide an opportunity to integrate and apply the information learned about the structure and function of the nervous system in the rest of the course to solving a focused clinical problem in a journal club format. Variable class schedule; contact course instructors. This course is offered to graduate and M.D./Ph.D. students only and cannot be audited.",
