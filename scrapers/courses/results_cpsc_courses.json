The goal of this course is to design state-of-the-art algorithms for various classical discrete problems through the use of continuous optimization methods. The approach is to first formulate a problem over a discrete domain as a continuous (convex) optimization problem, even though the problem is over a discrete domain, adapt or develop deterministic or randomized continuous-time dynamical systems to solve it, and then design algorithms for the problem via appropriate discretizations. The algorithmic applications include maximum flow in graphs, maximum matching in bipartite graphs, linear programming, submodular function minimization, and counting problems involving discrete objects such as matroids. We present approaches including gradient descent, mirror descent, interior-point methods, and cutting plane methods. Only one of CPSC 365, CPSC 366 or CPSC 368 may be taken for credit.",

Inquiries into the transpacific history of computer science (CS) can teach us that these relationships have been much more dynamic than \u2018Friend or Foe,\u2019 and have shaped CS in various ways. When cutting-edge computing capabilities are at the forefront of national interests, studying CS and U.S.-Asia relations should no longer be separate intellectual tasks, and multi-view perspectives are needed to understand both processes.\u00a0This seminar discusses decentered, international history of CS. We focus on the transpacific relations between the United States and East Asian countries, including Asian diasporas in North America. The course focuses on CS research and engineering, with less emphasis on (anti-)social implications such as mis/dis-information and data privacy.\u00a0The subjects of study include: China-born first-generation digital computer pioneers; digitizing Asian characters; developing transpacific networks of computers and labor; transpacific works in building CS fundamentals. The course culminates with current moods of exclusionism, trade protectionism, and \u2018friendshoring\u2019 across Asia-Pacific regions.",

We then consider kernel methods to enable us to solve nonlinear problems. Additionally, we introduce the concept of generalization error and overfitting. We discuss the role of regularization and extend linear regression to ridge regression. We also cover optimization, beginning from gradient descent and extending it to stochastic gradient descent and its momentum variant; the concept of alternating optimization; the curse of dimensionality; and topics on dimensionality reduction. We conclude the course with neural networks: how to build them using the topics discussed, how to optimize them, and how to apply them to solve a range of machine learning tasks.",

We introduce a linear function, discuss how one can train a linear function on a given dataset, and utilize it to tackle classification and regression problems. We then consider kernel methods to enable us to solve nonlinear problems. Additionally, we introduce the concept of generalization error and overfitting. We discuss the role of regularization and extend linear regression to ridge regression. We also cover optimization, beginning from gradient descent and extending it to stochastic gradient descent and its momentum variant; the concept of alternating optimization; the curse of dimensionality; and topics on dimensionality reduction. We conclude the course with neural networks: how to build them using the topics discussed, how to optimize them, and how to apply them to solve a range of machine learning tasks.",

Inquiries into the transpacific history of computer science (CS) can teach us that these relationships have been much more dynamic than \u2018Friend or Foe,\u2019 and have shaped CS in various ways. When cutting-edge computing capabilities are at the forefront of national interests, studying CS and U.S.-Asia relations should no longer be separate intellectual tasks, and multi-view perspectives are needed to understand both processes. This course combines lectures with team-based activities to explore the decentered, international history of CS. We focus on the transpacific relations between the United States and East Asian countries, including Asian diasporas in North America. The course focuses on CS research and engineering, with less emphasis on (anti-)social implications such as mis/dis-information and data privacy. The subjects of study include: China-born first-generation digital computer pioneers; digitizing Asian characters; developing transpacific networks of computers and labor; transpacific works in building CS fundamentals. The course culminates with current moods of exclusionism, trade protectionism, and \u2018friendshoring\u2019 across Asia-Pacific regions.",

Students may not earn credit for both CPSC 210 and CPSC 310.",

    "description": "For a long time there has been interest in distributed computation and decision making problems of all types. Among these are consensus and flocking problems, the multi-agent rendezvous problem, distributed averaging, gossiping, localization of sensors in a multi-sensor network, distributed algorithms for solving linear equations, distributed management of multi-agent formations, opinion dynamics, and distributed state estimation. The aim of this course is to explain what these problems are and to discuss their solutions. Related concepts from spectral graph theory, rigid graph theory, non-homogeneous Markov chain theory, stability theory, and linear system theory are covered. Although most of the mathematics need is covered in the lectures, students taking this course should have a working understanding of basic linear algebra. The course is open to all students.",
